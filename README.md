## Write HTML in Coffee-Script!

The [documentation](http://nickperkinslondon.github.com/coffee-mug/coffeemug_docs.html) is generated by a Coffee-Script [program] (https://github.com/nickperkinslondon/coffee-mug/blob/master/generate_docs.coffee) using Coffee-Mug.  The examples in the documents are extracted directly from the unit-tests, so they are guaranteed to work exactly as advertised.
