Templates are actual coffeescript functions.
This one avoids all the "magic" ( converting template function to string, adding code, compiling back to function ).

All of the html tag functions are attached to the "this" object, so in coffeescript the tags become : @html, @head, @h1, etc.
The data is passed explicitly to the template function, so it is named whatever the template names it.
In fact, a template could easily require more than one "data" object -- they are simply the parameters to the template function.

Most of the ideas ( and some of the code ) are borrowed from coffeeKup/coffeeCup
The big difference here is that the html tag functions are not injected by "magic", they are passed as the "this" object to the template function.
